# Hyper Directory POC

**Highly auditable blockchain-based, access management solution.**

Hyper Directory is a **proof-of-concept** for a Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain based access management solution. Created by T-Mobile's Cloud Center of Excellence and Intel, Hyper Directory allows you to create a source of truth for both standalone RESTful web applications and traditional LDAP based directory service functions. Integrate your application or directory with a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model and on the fly permission management layered under a beautiful UI. Allow approvals to traverse a hierarchy, and enable self-service management that works at enterprise scale.

* RESTful API interfaces allow simple integration with a wide range of modern web applications
* Single-page UI can be run on S3, which provides beautiful and intuitive management of RBAC users and groups
* Hyperledger Sawtooth based Blockchain ledger provides secure and auditable back-end
* Smart contract based hierarchical self-service approval and access management

Use Hyper Directory as the access management solution for your RESTful cloud solutions, including T-Mobile [Jazz](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz).

Keep an eye out for future functionality including REST integration layers for legacy directories based on the LDAP protocol.

Hyper Directory is [open-sourced](http://opensource.t-mobile.com) and under active development by T-Mobile's Cloud Center of Excellence.
